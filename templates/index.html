		We aim at developing useful Open Source applications and content for
	  use on Aakash. These will encompass the entire educational
	  spectrum from schools to colleges, and from vocational
	  training to professional studies. Our goal is to complete
	  useful development of engineering colleges, and to build a
	  large community of thousands of these talented professional
	  students and teachers, to carry out large scale development
	  of applications and content for use in all schools and
	  colleges. Content in Indian languages will receive special
	  attention.
</br></br>
	  The Aakash Lab has been set up in the department of CSE
	  (Computer Science and Engineering Department) at Indian
	  Institute of Technology Bombay, to drive this project. With
	  the increasing convergence of communication and computing
	  technologies, tablet computers are fast emerging as popular
	  consumer devices. In coming years, Aakash is likely to
	  become a ubiquitous tool in the hands of students, at all
	  levels of their education.</br></br>

	  from these colleges, to carry out large scale development of
	  applications and content for use in all schools and

	  Building upon the past work at IIT Bombay, the team made
	  substantial progress, and the work continues in full
	  swing. It has added key functionalities through these
	  applications.
