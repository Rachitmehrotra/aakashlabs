Aakash tablet is part of the central government Rs 4612 crore national mission on education through information and communication technology (NMEICT), launched in 2009. The mission aims to increase the “enrollment in higher education” and take delivery of education to “citizens’ doorstep” through creation of a national digital knowledge repository which can be freely accessed by anyone and everyone over the internet. </p><br><br> </div>

The low cost access and computing device was christened Aakash and was launched on 5 Oct. 2011 by the then Human Resource Development Minister, Shri Kapil Sibal.
In order to bring Aakash closer to people’s expectations, the specifications were redrawn in a meeting held between MHRD, IIT Rajasthan and Datawind in Nov. 2011. In this meeting, Datawind agreed to provide a capacitive touch screen in lieu of the resistive screen. </p><br></div>

They also agreed to provide the tablet at Rs. 2,276, the rupee equivalent of $49.98 on the day the purchase order was placed. This would more correctly account for the delays, while protecting against the fluctuations in the exchange rates. This new improved device was christened as Aakash 2.
