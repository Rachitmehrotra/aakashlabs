	  In March 2012, the Aakash project was transferred to IIT
	  Bombay, with CDAC as its testing partner. As IIT Rajasthan
	  selected Datawind through due diligence, following all CAG
	  norms, IIT Bombay decided to procure Aakash 2 from the same
	  vendor. IIT Bombay negotiated with Datawind once again and
	  froze the prices at Rs. 2,263. </br>In July 2012, Datawind
	  agreed to upgrade the device to a better one without any
	  cost escalation. The new device would have 512 MB RAM, 1GHz
	  ARM Cortex A8 processor, Android 4.0 operating system and a
	  gravity sensor, all upgrades over the purchase order issued
	  by IIT Bombay in May 2012.The specifications of this device
	  are 800 MHz ARM Cortex A8, 256 MB RAM, 2GB NAND flash, 2GB
	  SD card, 7”display with 800x480 resolution, four point multi
	  touch projective capacitive touch panel, Android 2.3 or
	  later. They also agreed to provide the tablet at Rs. 2,276,
	  the rupee equivalent of $49.98 on the day the purchase order
	  was placed. This would more correctly account for the
	  delays, while protecting against the fluctuations in the
	  exchange rates. This new improved device was christened as
	  Aakash 2.<br /><br />

	  The low cost access and computing device was christened
    Aakash and was launched on 5 Oct. 2011 by the then Human Resource
    Development Minister, Shri Kapil Sibal.  In order to bring Aakash
    closer to people’s expectations, the specifications were redrawn
    in a meeting held between MHRD, IIT Rajasthan and Datawind in
    Nov. 2011. In this meeting, Datawind agreed to provide a
    capacitive touch screen in lieu of the resistive screen.<br>Aakash
    tablet is part of the central government Rs 4612 crore national
    mission on education through information and communication
    technology (NMEICT), launched in 2009.</p></div>

	  <h4>NMEICT</h4>
	  
	  National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT) was
	  launched by Human Resource Development Minister Shri Arjun
	  Singh inaugurated at Tirupati on 2 Feb. 2009, with an outlay
	  of Rs. 4,612 crore, equivalent to one billion US$ at the
	  prevailing exchange rates. Out of this sum, about 60% was
	  allocated to provide good bandwidth to universities
	  and colleges and the remaining was meant for content
	  development and a low cost access and computing device.  The
	  objective of this mission was to raise the levels of
	  education in India. It was an initiative of the Department
	  of Higher Education, MHRD, Government of India.
